TECHNICAL INFORMATION:-
	
	Person class is defined in person.py which is inherited into Player as well as Enemy Classes .	 
	
	Modularity is implemented every class is in different .py files and are imported if neccessary. 

	Polymorphism is implemented where plenty of enemies are created from the same Enemy Classes and
		there individual methods like move_left(), move_right() etc worked fine without disturbing
		player's move_left() and move_right() methods

	Encapsulation is also being implemented.

	For bonus , the termcolor package is installed --> https://pypi.python.org/pypi/termcolor can be downloaded from here 
	and is used to give colour to characters.
